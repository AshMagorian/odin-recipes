            Learn how to make meatballs with this recipe that is the best meatball recipe I have ever tried! I've used the combination of pork, beef, and veal but you can make them with just ground beef and they still taste great. Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety... It really does make a difference!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground meat:</strong> This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Italian bread:</strong> Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Fry the meatballs in olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
